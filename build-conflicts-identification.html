                  <div class="abstract"> 
                    Build conflicts are resulted of <i>Errored</i> builds. Once this kind of builds might have many causes, we filter the merge scenarios that present errored builds but are motivated due to external or remote problems. Thus, we investigate only errored builds caused by errors during the compilation and ASAT phases of the build process.
                    <p>We identify two categories of conflicts: static semantic and other static analysis. Following, we explain the causes associated to each category. 
                    <!-- <p>Our scripts adopt syntatic diffs to check conflicts (this process is described <a href="gumtree-diff.html" title="">here</a>) -->
                    <p>*Some build process links redirect to GitHub repository commits aiming to hide the authors identity. </p>

            <h3>Checking Conflicting Contributions</h3>
            <section class="page col-sm-9">
              In this section, we discuss how we classify <i>errored</i> builds caused by conflicting contributions in a merge scenario. 
              Thus, after we identify an <i>errored</i> build associated with a merge scenario (without look for the parents commits build status), we check whether the parent contributions are conflicting with each other. To check conflicitng contributions, our scripts adopt syntatic diffs extracting the individual changes of each parent (this process is described <a href="gumtree-diff.html" title="">here</a>)
            <h4>Static Semantic Conflicts</h4>
            
            <p> This category of problems is related to source code syntactically correct but semantically wrong.
					  
            <div class="row">
              
              <h4> 1. Unavailable Symbol </h4>
              <p> Such conflict cause happens when a reference for a symbol no longer available in the project is introduced by one parent, while another parent removes it. For example, consider the <a href="https://github.com/datastax/java-driver" title="" target="_blank">Java Driver</a> project that presents a build conflict caused by <i>Unavailable Symbol</i> (missing method). Looking at the <a href="https://travis-ci.org/datastax/java-driver/builds/144600040" title="" target="_blank">build process</a> (see log report bellow), it is possible to see a reference for a missing symbol. In this case, the <i>Activator</i> class (main class) requires the use of the missing method <i>builderWithHighestTrackableLatencyMillis</i> that should be provided by the <i>PerHostPercentileTracker</i> class (secondary class).

                <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#blue; padding: 1em; height: 120px; width: 500px;"> 
                  <span style="color: red;"> COMPILATION FAILURE: </span> <br>
                  [ERROR] /home/[...]/datastax/driver/osgi/impl/<span style="color: red;">Activator</span>.java:[77,89] <br>

                <p> To verify if the errored build is caused by conflicting parent's contributions, our scripts adopt the following approach done in three steps: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> <b>Step 1:</b> Identification of the parent responsible for updating or removing the <i>Unavailable Symbol</i> using the <i>Secondary</i> class;</li>
                  <li> <b>Step 2:</b> Verification for a new reference for the <i>Unavailable Symbol</i> in the <i>Main</i> class (considering the other parent);</li>
                  <li> <b>Step 3:</b> If the previous steps are successfully checked, we identify a build conflict cause an errored build.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
              <h4> 2. Uniplemented Method </h4>
						  <p> This cause happens when a class does not present an implementation of a method defined in the related interface (or in some cases extends by inheritance). For instance, in <a href="https://github.com/scribejava/scribejava/" title="" target="_blank">Scribe Java</a> project the <a href="https://github.com/scribejava/scribejava/commit/d4e9733" title="" target="_blank">build process</a> breaks due to the unimplemented method (see log report bellow). In this case, the method <i>executeAsync</i> (unimplemented method) is introduced in the interface <i>HttpClient</i> (secondary class). However, the implementing class <i>OkHttpHttpClient</i> (main class) does not present the associated new implementation.

                <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#blue; padding: 1em; height: 120px; width: 500px;">

                <p> To verify if the errored build is caused by conflicting parent's contributions, our scripts adopt the following approach done in four steps: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> <b>Step 1:</b> Identification of the parent responsible for updating or introducing the <i>unimplemented method</i> in the <i>Secondary class</i>;</li>
                  <li> <b>Step 2:</b> In the other parent, our scripts perform two checks. The first verifies whether the <i>unimplemented method</i> is added or updated in the <i>Secondary class</i> (ensuring the change in the <i>Secondary class</i> is preserved in the merge result); </li>
                  <li> <b>Step 3:</b> Following, our scripts whether the <i>Main class</i> does not present any change related to the addition/update of the <i>unimplemented method</i>; </li>
                  <li> <b>Step 4:</b> If these checks can be done, a build conflict happend and cause an errored build.</li>
                </ul>
					  </div>

            <div class="row">
              <h4> 3. Incompatible Method Signature </h4>
              <p> Different of Unavailable Symbol Method, in this case the required method is available but the list of parameters or the types expected are different of those received. For instance, in <a href="https://github.com/ontop/ontop" title="" target="_blank"> Ontop </a> project, the <a href="https://travis-ci.org/ontop/ontop/builds/113479426" title="" target="_blank"> build process </a> breaks because the constructor (<i>incompatible method</i>) of <i>Quest (secondary class)</i> could not be used in the request of <i>SQLGenerator (main class)</i> since the parameters list differ in length, see log report bellow.

                <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#blue; padding: 1em; height: 120px; width: 500px;">

                <p> To verify if the errored build is caused by conflicting parent's contributions, our scripts adopt the following approach done in two steps: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> <b>Step 1:</b> Identification of the parent responsible for updating/removing the <i>incompatible method</i> in the <i>Secondary class</i>. Since many methods can have the same name, differing with each other in the method signature, the scripts check the number of methods with the name of the <i>incompatible method</i> available in the <i>Secondary class</i> of each parent;</li>
                  <li> <b>Step 2:</b> If each parent presents a different number of methods or parameter list size, we assume the <i>incompatible method</i> was available before the merge integration. Thus, one of the parents removed the method leading the build to break due to conflicting contribution.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
              <h4> 4. Duplicated Declaration </h4>
              <p> Different of <i>Incompatible Methods Signature</i>, in this case two elements with the same identifier are declared in a class (variable, method). Thus, when a requestion is done for such element, the program can not decide which one to use. <a href="https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints" title="" target="_blank">Blueprints</a> project has a <a href="https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/commit/5a25e3a" title="" target="_blank"> build process </a>that breaks because of two declarations of method <i>testRemoveNonExistentVertexCausesException (duplicated method)</i> in the <i>GraphTestSuite (main class)</i>.

                <p> To verify if the errored build is caused by conflicting parent's contributions, our scripts adopt the following approach done in two steps: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> <b>Step 1:</b> Checking for the introduction of the duplicated method in <i>Main class</i> in both parents;</li>
                  <li> <b>Step 2:</b> If such check is done, a build conflict is the responsible for the errored build. </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
              <h4> 5. Incompatible Types </h4>
              <p> This problem happens when an unexpected type is received or sent in a request. For example, in <a href="https://github.com/graphaware/neo4j-timetree" title="" target="_blank">Neo4J TimeTree</a> project, the <a href="https://github.com/graphaware/neo4j-timetree/commit/66d2770" title="" target="_blank">build process</a> fails because a parameter of type <i>long</i> is sent instead of <i>TimeInstant</i> in <i>getInstant</i> method of <i>TimeTree</i> class (see log report bellow). 

                <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#blue; padding: 1em; height: 120px; width: 500px;">

                  incompatible types <span style="color: red;">long</span> cannot be converted to <span style="color: red;">TimeInstant</span> </p>

                <p> To verify whether a build conflict is responsible for the broken build, in cases one of the parent commits has errored build status, we perform a manual analysis to verify the conflict occurrence. This manual analysis follows the ideas implemented for the other erros and also using <a href="gumtree-diff.html" title="">GumTree</a> diffs.

            <p>Static analysis are done after the compilation process. 
            It means the source code is compilable, but additional analysis after the compilation phase identify problems that lead the build process to break. 
            The common analysis done involves checking of styles/convetions adopted by projects, duplication of code. </p>
            
            <div class="row">

              <p> This problem happens when the source code is syntactically and semantically correct, but it does not follow the conventions/guidelines defined to the project. For instance, in the <a href="https://github.com/datastax/java-driver" title="" target="_blank">Java Driver</a> project, a file does not have the <i>expected license header</i> resulting in a broken <a href="https://github.com/datastax/java-driver/commit/f19c84b" title="" target="_blank">build process</a> (see log report bellow).

            <section class="page col-sm-9">
              In case our scripts can not verify conflicting contributions of parents commits, we perform an additional analysis. Just like the previous approach to verify conflicting contributions, after we identify a merge scenario associated with an errored build, we perform the following two checks:
              <ul>
                <li>First, we check whether the parents commits are associated to build process with status superior to errored (in this case, <i>failed</i> or <i>passed</i>). This property tells us that before the merge scenario, the parents commits did not present any problem during the compilation and ASAT phases of the build process. 
                <li>Following, we verify whether changes are performed after the merge scenario simulating the merge scenario. If no change is performed, we conclude the parent contributions are conflicting leading the build process to break due to build conflicts.</li>
