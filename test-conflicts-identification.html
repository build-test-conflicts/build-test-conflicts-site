                  <div class="abstract"> 
                    Test Conflicts are resulted of <i>failed</i> builds. This kind of errors might be motivated by many reasons. After eliminating the scenarios that builds present failed status due to external or remote reasons, we analyze the cases that failures or errors happen during the test execution phase of the build process. In this section, we discuss how we classify <i>failed</i> builds caused by conflicting contributions involving in a merge scenario. We identify two categories of test conflicts: failed test cases and unachieved coverage. 
                    <p>Like the approach adopted to classify build conflicts, we also adopt syntatic diffs to get information about the parents contributions. For that we improved GumTree tool to have more information about the changes (source code available <a href="https://github.com/build-test-conflicts/gumtree" title="">here</a>)

              <h3>Failed Test Cases</h3>
              <p> Problems during the testing phase of a build process are often caused by failed test cases, which may be motivated by failures as also errors during the test execution phase. Failures represent an unexpected software behavior, while errors represent the incapability of executing a test case due to unexpected operations. For a failed build, Travis log reports the failed test case and its associated test class. </p>
  			
              <p>To ensure test case failure occurs because of the intersection of parent’s contributions and not by external causes, we decide to individually execute each failed test case again. During this re-execution, we compute the classes and methods exercised by the test. 

              <p>Aditionally, to verify whether the methods and classes changed during the parents contributions are exercised during the test case execution, using the syntatic <a href="gumtree-diff.html" title="">diff</a>, we compute the changes performed by each parent. With these information, we can evaluate whether the changes performed by the parents are executed by the test case revealing a possible impact of the changes in the failed test. </p>

              <p>Basically, our approach consists of two steps: (i) test case execution, (ii) parents changes, and (iii) analysis of code coverage and parent’s contributions.</p>
            </div>  

            <div class="row">
              <h4> Test Case Execution </h4>
              <p> After our scripts parse Travis log getting the failed test case and its test class, we instrument the <i>travis.yml</i> file to run only one test case by build. For that, we specify the test case and its test class as an instruction on this configuration file.
              Once such restriction is supported, our scripts instrument the configuration file (<i>pom.xml</i>) to compute the related code coverage information. For that, it is necessary to add a new dependency for a tool responsible for generating the coverage. 
              Finally, it is necessary to deploy this information out of Travis environment. So, our scripts instrument the <i>travis.yml</i> file to save the code coverage in GitHub (using git tags).

            <div class="row">
              <h4> Parents Changes </h4>
              <p> Our scripts basically save the chages performed by each parent commit using the syntatic <a href="gumtree-diff.html" title="">diff</a>.
              There are two types of changes we can evaluate about the classes changed by parent’s contributions: class structure or methods. For getting class structure changes, the scripts consider any change done in a class, which can be identified through the original GumTree report. Although GumTree presents all changes performed between two files, it does not associate the changes with their methods. Nevertheless, to perform part of this analysis in this step, our scripts must know the changed methods. To solve this issue, we improved the <a href="https://github.com/build-test-conflicts/gumtree" target="_blank">GumTree tool</a> report by adding the information of related methods into diff reports when it applies.

            	<h4>Code Coverage and Parent’s Contributions</h4>
            	<p>Thus, we have information that allow us to verify impact between parent's contributions in the failed test case. Based in these information, our scripts analyse the coverage results and the files changes during parent’s contributions looking for two types of dependency, as presented in Figure 1, bellow. Orange and blue circumferences represent the set of classes changed by each parent, respectivelly, while the yellow circumference refers to the set classes exercised by the test case. </p>
              <p>As can be seen in Figure 1, we can extract two information:
              <ul>
                <li> (A) Intersection among exercised and changed parents classes. Parents changes the same classes that are exercised by the test case. </li>
                <li> (B) Intersection between exercised and changed classes for each parent. Parents change different classes but dependent during the test case execution. </li>
              </ul>

            </div>
            <p>Additionally, our scripts verify whether changes happen in the failed test cases leading us to consider interferences between changed classes and test cases (new, changed or old test cases).</p>

            <h3>Unachived Coverage Metric</h3>
            <p>The other type of test conflict we consider is related to coverage metrics on source code. This kind of metric is computed after the test execution. In this situation, the coverage metrics established for the project are not achieved anymore. For example, in <a href="https://travis-ci.org/jwtk/jjwt/builds/280062604" title="" target="_blank">JJWT</a> project, the coverage metric defined previously for the project is not achieved, as presented bellow. </p>
            
            <br>
              <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#blue; padding: 1em; height: 140px; width: 500px;"> 
                  <span style="color: red;"> Build failed to meet Clover coverage targets: The following coverage targets for null were not met: </span> <br>
                  [ERROR] Total coverage of <span style="color: red;">93.3%</span> did not meet target of <span style="color: red;">100%</span> <br>
                  [ERROR] Method coverage of <span style="color: red;">95%</span> did not meet target of <span style="color: red;">100%</span><br>
                  [ERROR] Statement coverage of <span style="color: red;">92.5%</span> did not meet target of <span style="color: red;">100%</span><br>
                  [ERROR] Conditional coverage of <span style="color: red;">94.4%</span> did not meet target of <span style="color: red;">100%</span><br>
            <br>

            <p> For these scenarios, we do not run any test case since the conflict happens due to the not-achievement of the metric defined previously.
